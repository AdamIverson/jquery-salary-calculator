# Weekend jQuery Salary Calculator
**48 Hours of Joy**

## Description

Folks, what we have here is a salary calculator. Now what this is going to do is take in a first name, last name, employee identification number, job title, and an annual salary for a single employee. That information will be displayed on the DOM, along with one delete button per employee. Monthly expenses will be calculated and shown in the DOM. If you use the delete button, that specific employee's information will be removed from the DOM. The monthly total will continue to reflect the deleted employee's salary, however, because that ship has sailed for the week. Thank you for playing. 

## Screen Shot

I took a screenshot and I looked up how to include it and then I typed this sentence.

## Installation

ur doing great

## Usage

1. Enter information into input fields.
2. Click Submit.
3. Get a load of this all-star lineup of employees.
4. If you go over $20,000 per month in total expenses, your eyes are going to hear about it.
5. If you don't like looking at someone, you can delete them, but you are forever burdened with the weight of their salary. I'm sorry this happened to you, but you're going to have to pay these workers their money or you're going to be looking at a lot of red backgrounds moving forward.
