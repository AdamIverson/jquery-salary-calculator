# Project Name
Weekend jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

Folks, what we have here is a salary calculator. Now what this is going to do is take in a first name, last name, employee identification number, job title, and an annual salary for a single employee. That information will be displayed on the DOM, along with one delete button per employee. Monthly expenses will be calculated and shown in the DOM. If you use the delete button, that specific employee's information will be removed from the DOM. The monthly total will continue to reflect the deleted employee's salary, however, because that ship has sailed for the week. Thank you for playing.
